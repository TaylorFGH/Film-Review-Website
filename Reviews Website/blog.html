            <h2>Christopher Nolan Has No Competiton</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">Published on: December 11 , 2024 - Taylor McGonagle</p>
            <p>Today I uploaded and reviewed three movies  onto my page and to no suprise, not to me anyway they
                are all masterpieces made and directed by Christopher Nolan. Now I could go on for hours about how
                he is the best director of our time and you always feel something different watching each one of his movies.
                They way he films is so unique like still filming on IMAX adds a different vibe and aspect to his work like no other,
                oh and his cast picks are always mental, filled with great A listers.

            <h2>Action Dramas Will Never Be Topped</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">Published on: December 12, 2024 - Taylor McGonagle</p>
            <p>There is something about watching a good drama or thriller tv show with a good 
                story and cast that i dont think will ever be topped. I have watched so many
                over the years but the three i added recently are definitely up there as probably my top 3
                , if you havent seen them i HIGHLY recommend you do.
